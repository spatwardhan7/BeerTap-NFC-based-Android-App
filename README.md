BeerTap-NFC-based-Android-App
=============================

In crowded restaurants / bars people have to overcome long queues and loud noise to place their order. 
People have to wait for a host and a menu card before deciding and placing their orders. 
Shouting orders over the bar in incoherent accents will be replaced by simple taps through NFC enabled smart phones. 

This application will help customers and restaurant owners to effectively communicate orders and billing information through their NFC enabled smart phones.


When a customer enters a restaurant they will be able to get the updated menu by tapping their phone on an NFC phone/tag at the entrance. 
From the populated menu on their smart phones they can select what they wish to order and tap another tag/phone to place the order and send 
payment information. The host will then be able to view the order on a web interface (phone, tablet or a monitor).

BeamNFC : Send NDEF message which contains the menu link to the BeerTap application. This was created in case there are no NFC tags available to store menu links

BeerTap: Application created for users which fetches restsurant menu from the link and allows users to select their order. To complete order, users tap their phone 
         on the restaurant tab/phone to send their order.
